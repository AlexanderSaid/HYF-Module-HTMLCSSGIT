## 1. **`ls`** : List directory contents

  I use it constantly to check what files and folders does my directory contain, and I can also listing them using `-l` and show the hidden files using `-a`

## 2. **`touch`** : Creates a file

  A fast way to create files through `bash`, and combine it with other commands like `code` or `notepad` it's easy to open them in my favorite editors and edit them.

## 3. **`cd`** : Change directory

  I like how easy to navigate in my directories using `cd` combined with `tab` key, I just need to logically name my directories and use the first letters and **boom** here is the full directory name popup.
